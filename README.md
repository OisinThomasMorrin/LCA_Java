# LCA_Java
Implementation of LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) in Java

This java repository only contains the code for LCA 1.
Part 2 can be found in the python repository.
I had been planning on doing part 2 in java as well, but I noticed a bug that caused my implementation to get very messy.
Therefore, my submission says part 2 of LCA is available here, but I'd like to redicrect you to https://github.com/OisinThomasMorrin/LCA_Python for Part 2.
